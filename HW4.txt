/* I have given you the Monty Hall code on Brightspace, under Code.

Write functioning Unit Tests for the SwitchingPlayer. You want to test that, when the player selects the first door:

1. It should be a door index in the range of 0 to 2 inclusive
2. The door the player has selected is one that was closed beforehand
And, when the player selects the second door:

1. It should be a door index in the range of 0 to 2 inclusive
2. The door the player has selected is one that was closed beforehand
3. It should not be the same selection as the first selection */
